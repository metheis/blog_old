                <p>For most things that I want to accomplish in a Linux environment, I can generally either find the
                    direct solution through a quick google search, or parse solutions to analogous but disparate
                    problems and adapt them to my situation. However, I do not expect to find solutions for issues and
                    configuration challenges I arrive at with Intel’s Clear Linux.</p>
                <p>For those unfamiliar with Clear Linux, it is a Linux distribution with several optimizations for
                    Intel processors. Some people refer to it as a “benchmark distribution” because it runs extremely
                    quickly (arguably the fastest publicly available operating system in the world). It is also
                    “bleeding edge” because it is a rolling distribution: it receives kernel and package changes from
                    upstream sources within a matter of days or weeks. Larger Linux distributions such as Debian,
                    Ubuntu, Red Hat, Centos etc. release a major version of the Linux Kernel every few years and keep
                    the operating system there. Security updates and other essential features that are added to the main
                    kernel after release are then “backported.” Clear Linux does not need to do this because it keeps
                    the entire kernel up to date. I could make an entire separate post about Clear Linux and how it
                    differs from other operating systems, but for now, this explanation will suffice.</p>
                <p>Apart from being a relatively young distribution, Clear Linux does not have many users because many
                    applications do not support it, and because parts of its design make day to day usage less
                    convenient than the likes of Ubuntu (however this has gotten better over time). This has a major
                    impact: there is significantly less community
                    support around it, so finding guides or question/answers to projects I want to implement is more
                    difficult. Therefore, in almost everything I do, I need to learn via adaptation from other OSs.
                    This is includes running virtual machines.</p>
                <p>KVM, a popular Linux method of running VMs, runs performantly because it resides within the kernel of
                    the OS. It rivals the speed of a bare metal hypervisors (such as VMware). There exists ample
                    documentation on running Clear Linux as a guest OS on KVM, however, little on using Clear Linux as
                    the host for other virtual machines. The following guide goes over how I use Clear Linux as a KVM
                    host.</p>
